# Lang_Asm_Proc
My programming language.
here you can see not only the language itself but Assembler and Processor also.
Firstly, you type your code in file, then launch my program-compilator.
It checks syntax errors and if everything is fine, creates Assembler-Code.
Then launches Assembler which gets all low-level comands to bin code.
Now Processor starts execute your program.
Language->Assembler->Processor
All are happy:)
