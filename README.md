# Lang_Asm_Proc
My programming language.
here you can see not only the language itself but Assembler and Processor also.
Firstly, you type your code in file, then launch my program-compilator.
It checks syntax errors and if everything is fine, creates Assembler-Code.
Then launches Assembler which gets all low-level comands to bin code.
Now Processor starts execute your program.
Language->Assembler->Processor
All are happy:)
As an example i wrote small Factorial program which reads number from input and prints the answer in file.
PS. There is tree expression also which is illustrated with help of graphviz.
The proplem is that it doesnot recognise symbols like '<', '>' and some others 
so it can look strange in nodes where such symbols are present
